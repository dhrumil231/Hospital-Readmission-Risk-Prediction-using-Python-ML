# Hospital-Readmission-Risk-Prediction-using-Python-ML
Hospital Readmission Risk Prediction using Machine Learning - This project, titled "Hospital Readmission Risk Prediction using Machine Learning," is a data science initiative that leverages machine learning to forecast the likelihood of patients being readmitted to a hospital. Utilizing a comprehensive healthcare dataset, the project aims to identify key factors contributing to readmission and build a predictive model to help healthcare providers improve patient care and resource management.

üè• Project Overview & Key Features- This project utilizes a structured healthcare dataset to predict hospital readmission rates. The analysis and modeling are contained within a single Jupyter Notebook.

Key features include:
1) Extensive Data Preprocessing: The notebook demonstrates how to handle missing values, clean data, and prepare it for model training.
2) Advanced Feature Engineering: The project applies advanced feature selection techniques, such as Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) and the Boruta algorithm, to identify the most predictive features.
3) Comprehensive Model Evaluation: A wide range of supervised learning models are implemented and evaluated using key performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing model.

üìä Methodology & Results
The machine learning workflow follows these steps:
1) Data Exploration: Initial data loading and cleaning, including handling missing values and analyzing feature distributions.
2) Feature Selection: Employing advanced algorithms to select the most impactful features for the predictive models.
3) Model Training: Implementing and training a diverse set of supervised learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks (MLP).
4) Performance Analysis: Evaluating and comparing the models to identify the most effective solution.

The SVM model was found to be the most promising, achieving an accuracy of approximately 49.79% on the test set. The project includes a detailed classification report and confusion matrix to provide a transparent view of the model's performance on precision, recall, and F1-score for both positive and negative classes.
